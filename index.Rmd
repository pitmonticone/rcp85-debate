# 10. â€œ Adopting a formal BAU scenario in the context energy forecasters in this thread desire is a decision policymakers would need to make (but they don't seem to get that!).
```
## Glossary

* $BAU$: "Business-As-Usual"
* $RF$: "Radiative Forcing"
* $RCPX$: "Representative Concentration Pathway with $RF(2100)\approx X$"
* $SSP$: "Shared Socioeconomic Pathway"
* $T$: "Temperature"
* $U$: "Utility"

## Propositions 

1. *Emissions Narratives $\neq$ Emissions $\neq RF \neq T$ $\neq$ Impacts*

1. *Narratives for $SSP5-RCP8.5$ are too fossil-heavy given current best estimate for $BAU$*

1. *$RF(2100)\approx 8.5 W/{m^2}$ is very unlikely*

1. *$RF_{RCP8.5}$ shouldn't be used as no-policy baseline*

1. *$U_{\text{modellers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU}) > U_{\text{policymakers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU})$ ^[e.g. to test and compare models, to explore impacts, etc.]*

1. *$\Delta T_{BAU}(\geq 2100) \approx \Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ for plausible values of sensitivity ^[$BAU$ \in \{ $IEA$, [Hausfather](https://twitter.com/hausfath) \& [Ritchie](https://twitter.com/jritch) \}]*

1. *$RCP8.5$-based results can be scientifically valid and policy-relevant, despite $\textit{EnergyUse}_{RCP8.5} \neq \textit{EnergyUse}_{BAU}$*

1. *Impacts consistent with $\Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ are not precluded by $BAU$*

1. *Claiming that RCP8.5-based studies are part of a scare tactic by scientists/media is a baseless conspiracy theory that has no place in adult conversation*

1. *Climate assessments should be well supported with robust communications and outreach resources*
