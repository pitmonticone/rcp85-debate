# Issues

1. *Emissions Narratives $\neq$ Emissions $\neq RF \neq T$ $\neq$ Impacts*

1. *Narratives for $SSP5-RCP8.5$ are too fossil-heavy given current best estimate for $BAU$*

1. *$RF(2100)\approx 8.5 W/{m^2}$ is very unlikely*

1. *$RF_{RCP8.5}$ shouldn't be used as no-policy baseline*

1. *$U_{\text{modellers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU}) > U_{\text{policymakers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU})$ ^[e.g. to test and compare models, to explore impacts, etc.]*

1. *$\Delta T_{BAU}(\geq 2100) \approx \Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ for plausible values of sensitivity ^[$BAU$ \in \{ $IEA$, [Hausfather](https://twitter.com/hausfath) \& [Ritchie](https://twitter.com/jritch) \}]*

1. *$RCP8.5$-based results can be scientifically valid and policy-relevant, despite $\textit{EnergyUse}_{RCP8.5} \neq \textit{EnergyUse}_{BAU}$*

1. *Impacts consistent with $\Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ are not precluded by $BAU$*

1. *Claiming that RCP8.5-based studies are part of a scare tactic by scientists/media is a baseless conspiracy theory that has no place in adult conversation*

1. *Climate assessments should be well supported with robust communications and outreach resources*

* Reformulate 3. as "RCP8.5 is very unlikely" 
* Add "RCP 8.5 should never be used in any SSPs but SSP5"
* Reformulate 4. as "RCP 8.5 should not be used as a no policy baseline in SSP 5 and should never be used in SSP1-4"

* From a climate modelling perspective, RCPs are simply concentration, or forcing, pathways.  They can be used to investigate how the climate will respond to different changes in atmosphere CO2 concentration (or forcing).
* Clearly, it's also useful to develop socio-economic pathways that could lead to the various concentration/forcing pathways.  It's become more and more clear that it's very unlikely that we'll follow a RCP8.5 pathway (but the same is probably true for RCP2.6).
* So, one might then say "climate models should only use pathways that we are likely to follow".  The problem is that there is a range of warming for each pathway (i.e., even along our current BAU pathway, it is something like 1.9C - 4.4C).
* The sensitivity of a climate model is emergent (i.e., it's not easy to tune it).  Hence, if one wants to investigate the impact of, for example, >4C of warming, one might need to force a climate model with a forcing pathway that is seen as being unrealistically high.
* This doesn't mean that the modellers are assuming that this is a BAU pathway, it simply means that the modellers are investigating the impact of high levels of warming which could happen if we continue along a BAU pathway, but climate sensitivity turns out to be high end. 
* That's essentially the point some are trying to make.  It may be very unlikely that we're going to follow an RCP8.5 forcing pathway, but since we can't rule out >4C of warming along our current BAU pathway, it may still be a useful pathway for climate impact studies.

* $BAU$: "Business-As-Usual"

* $RF$: "Radiative Forcing"

* $RCPX$: "Representative Concentration Pathway with $RF(2100)\approx X$"

* $RCP8.5$: 

     * Developed by the MESSAGE modeling team and the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework at the International Institute for Applies Systems Analysis (IIASA), Austria. 
     * Characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time representative for scenarios in the literature leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels. 
     * The underlying scenario drivers and resulting development path are based on the A2r scenario detailed in [Riahi et al. (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162506001387?via%3Dihub).
