# Issues

1. *Emissions Narratives $\neq$ Emissions $\neq RF \neq T$ $\neq$ Impacts*

1. *Narratives for $SSP5-RCP8.5$ are too fossil-heavy given current best estimate for $BAU$*

1. *$RF(2100)\approx 8.5 W/{m^2}$ is very unlikely*

1. *$RF_{RCP8.5}$ shouldn't be used as no-policy baseline*

1. *$U_{\text{modellers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU}) > U_{\text{policymakers }}(RF\gg RF_{BAU})$ ^[e.g. to test and compare models, to explore impacts, etc.]*

1. *$\Delta T_{BAU}(\geq 2100) \approx \Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ for plausible values of sensitivity ^[$BAU$ \in \{ $IEA$, [Hausfather](https://twitter.com/hausfath) \& [Ritchie](https://twitter.com/jritch) \}]*

1. *$RCP8.5$-based results can be scientifically valid and policy-relevant, despite $\textit{EnergyUse}_{RCP8.5} \neq \textit{EnergyUse}_{BAU}$*

1. *Impacts consistent with $\Delta T_{RCP8.5}(2100)$ are not precluded by $BAU$*

1. *Claiming that RCP8.5-based studies are part of a scare tactic by scientists/media is a baseless conspiracy theory that has no place in adult conversation*

1. *Climate assessments should be well supported with robust communications and outreach resources*

* I strongly believe we should try to condense what really matters in a bunch of clear, accurate points of convergence. Otherwise it would be extremely hard to see what we could possibly mean by progress in this conversation. ([Source](https://twitter.com/PietroMonticone/status/1208542046895693825?s=20))
* I'll try to include that in a quasi-formal suit of clear, unambiguous propositions in order to minimize misinterpretations, foster productive discussion and eventually policy-relevant convergence. ([Source](https://twitter.com/PietroMonticone/status/1208779678393262082?s=20))

* Reformulate 3. as "RCP8.5 is very unlikely" ([Source](https://twitter.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1209010954278756352?s=20))
* Add "RCP 8.5 should never be used in any SSPs but SSP5" ([Source](https://twitter.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1209012725931794433?s=20))
* Reformulate 4. as "RCP 8.5 should not be used as a no policy baseline in SSP 5 and should never be used in SSP1-4" ([Source](https://twitter.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1209012725931794433?s=20))
* Bottom line for me: let's stop trying to create fights where they are not useful and let's start to think how we can give AR6 more papers with a realistic BAU so AR6 gives policy makers a good grasp of what can be achieved by mitigation.

* Convene a research review, to look at all papers which use RCP8.5 explicitly or implicitly as BAU, or which compare it inappropriately with other SSPs. Triage into OK; needs new abstract and press release; must be withdrawn and corrected. And beer, we definitely gonna need beer! ([Source](https://twitter.com/MLiebreich/status/1207746005036351489?s=20))
* This is the heart of the discussion. RCP8.5 was originally based on massive coal growth. That is now seen as wildly improbable, but the climate community, many of whom think of RCP8.5 as BAU, still wants to keep using it despite failing to produce a plausible alternative pathway. ([Source](https://twitter.com/MLiebreich/status/1208886789378850816?s=20))

* From my perspective, the issue with the RCP design was that it had been well known in previous decades that if there is no BAU, then people will look for a BAU, and therefore we have to be explicit about that because otherwise people use implicit clues to guide them. ([Source](https://twitter.com/jritch/status/1207671030027825152?s=20))

#### Roger Pielke Jr.

* One big problem with $BAU$ is it’s use in $CBA$. Consider if we were to take Zeke & Justin analysis seriously & simply plug it into USNCA, the benefits of mitigation would be zero (obviously wrong). Due to fact that NCA calculated such benefits as impacts avoided/reduced = $BAU$ - $RCP4.5$ . ([Source](https://twitter.com/RogerPielkeJr/status/1207700090439131136?s=20))

#### Stefan Rahmstorf

* I don’t know how common that misunderstanding was, though. I have always presented $RCP8.5$ as the upper end of the range of possible futures. $RCP8.5$ is widely considered very unlikely among climatologists because the economic collapse setting in way before 4 degrees C warming. ([Source](https://twitter.com/rahmstorf/status/1207570677647249409?s=20))

* I tend to call it "high emissions scenario" in talks. I've always been uncomfortable with the fact that the actual impacts of climate change are neglected from the emissions scenarios from the IAMs - I can see why it's keeps the analysis simple, but surely it is inconsistent. ([Source](https://twitter.com/richardabetts/status/1207586161469927424?s=20))

* All of these can be true: 1. $RCP8.5$ narrative has too much fossil fuels ; 2. $8.5W/m^2$ by exactly 2100 no longer "BAU" ; c) current policy can get us within $RCP8.5$ levels of warming by 2100 or a few decades thereafter. ([Source](https://twitter.com/past_is_future/status/1208246363227598849?s=20))
* I'm seeing a lot of people take points 1. and 2. and use them to argue explicitly/implicitly against 3. , which as far as I can tell is a violent misrepresentation of the evidence available. That doesn't mean we'll necessarily see that much warming! It's just not _precluded_ by current policy/trends. ([Source](https://twitter.com/past_is_future/status/1208247342098456577?s=20))

* From a climate modelling perspective, $RCPs$ are simply concentration, or forcing, pathways.  They can be used to investigate how the climate will respond to different changes in atmosphere CO$_2$ concentration (or forcing). ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209138892600938496?s=20))
* Clearly, it's also useful to develop socio-economic pathways that could lead to the various concentration/forcing pathways.  It's become more and more clear that it's very unlikely that we'll follow a $RCP8.5$ pathway (but the same is probably true for $RCP2.6$). ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209139199846297600?s=20))
* So, one might then say "climate models should only use pathways that we are likely to follow".  The problem is that there is a range of warming for each pathway (i.e., even along our current $BAU$ pathway, it is something like $1.9°C$ - $4.4°C$). ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209139509872537614?s=20))
* The sensitivity of a climate model is emergent (i.e., it's not easy to tune it).  Hence, if one wants to investigate the impact of, for example, $> 4°C$ of warming, one might need to force a climate model with a forcing pathway that is seen as being unrealistically high. ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209139850449997824?s=20))
* This doesn't mean that the modellers are assuming that this is a $BAU$ pathway, it simply means that the modellers are investigating the impact of high levels of warming which could happen if we continue along a $BAU$ pathway, but climate sensitivity turns out to be high end. ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209140319201169414?s=20))
* That's essentially the point some are trying to make.  It may be very unlikely that we're going to follow an $RCP8.5$ forcing pathway, but since we can't rule out $> 4°C$ of warming along our current $BAU$ pathway, it may still be a useful pathway for climate impact studies. ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209140670318989313?s=20))
*  Most research groups will typically use a single climate model, which will have a single climate sensitivity. However, we know that there is an uncertainty in climate senstivity.  Hence if a research group wants to investigate the high levels of warming that might occur under a $BAU$ pathway, they may need to force their model with a higher than BAU forcing pathway. The impacts depends on the temperature change, not directly on the change in forcing. ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209146817776148480?s=20))
* If we want to explore the impacts of $> 4°C$ with a model known to have a low climate sensitivity, then we may need to use a higher than $BAU$ forcing pathway. ([Source](https://twitter.com/theresphysics/status/1209148009143033856?s=20))

* $RCP8.5$ is useful for understanding what might happen if emissions exceed current projections. ([Source](https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1209201769659527168?s=20))
* Year 2100 CO2 emissions in RCP8.5 are abut 30 GtC/yr, about 3 times greater than in 2020. Year 2020 CO2 emissions will be nearly 8 times greater than  in 1940, 80 years ago. ([Source](https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1209201769659527168?s=20))
* In $RCP8.5$, in the 80 years between 2020 and 2100, CO2 emissions increase on average by about 1.4%/yr. Historically, in the 80 years between 1940 and 2020, CO2 emissions increased on average by about 2.6%/yr. ([Source](https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1209219111659528193?s=20))
* For many studies, my preferred scenario is abrupt 4x CO$_2$ because it clearly demonstrates modeled climate response without implying anything about likelihood of different emissions scenarios in the real world. ([Source](https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1209219586672885760?s=20))
* Good experimental design might mean that the scenarios that should be simulated the most would be the ones with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The controversy is not about simulating the scenarios. It is about interpreting the results as most-likely no-policy outcomes. ([Source](https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1209225120750817280?s=20))
* The cumulative net emissions in RCP8.5 to year 2100 would represent a dramatic decrease in long-term CO2 emissions trends. These cumulative emissions cannot be ruled out as a plausible business-as-usual scenario, even if it is not our central expectation.

* Despite CO$_2$ emissions growing a factor of 10 since 1870, per capita emissions have grown a factor of 2. Per capita emissions have been flat since 1950, except for the Chinese growth in the 2000s. What would cause per capita emissions to grow in the future? ([Source](https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1209024593178038273?s=20))
* Take out land-use change, & increases in per capita emissions have come with new fossil sources. What is the next fossil source in increase per capita emissions? Will gas add to coal & oil, or displace it? Will non-fossil source displace fossil sources? ([Source](https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1209027198629371906?s=20))
* $RCP8.5$ (& some other no policy baselines) require CO$_2$ emissions per capita to double by 2050 & triple by 2100, despite being flat for the last 50 years & only doubling since 1900. RCP8.5 is without historical precedent. ([Source](https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1209028367774814208?s=20))
* Another way to put it, is that $RCP8.5$ assumes that coal grows faster than population. History shows that is rare. If emissions per capita remained at about 6, and population went to 10 billion (high end), then emissions would be 60GtCO2/yr, far lower than RCP85. ([Source](https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1209048300550283269?s=20))
* If population grows to 10 billion (sort of high-end), & CO$_2$ per capita remains at 6tCO$_2$/person (a little higher than the long-term trend), then emissions would reach 60GtCO$_2$/yr. $RCP8.5$ >120GtCO₂/yr. ([Source](https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1209059892176334848?s=20))
